Jihyun Kim, a ceramic designer from South Korea, melds tradition with enchantment in her craft. Holding a Master of Arts in Ceramics and Glass from the Royal College of Art, her work is internationally recognised, and showcased at esteemed events like Milan Design Week and the British Ceramic Biennale. 

Jihyun's creations beautifully blend sculptural and functional elements, inspired by her cultural heritage and nature's mystical aspects. Her exploration of organic forms, especially fungi, infuses her pieces with magical narratives, inviting viewers to discover magic in the mundane. With meticulous attention to detail and a fusion of artistic form and utility, Jihyun's ceramics transcend the ordinary, embodying a harmonious blend of tradition and imagination.
